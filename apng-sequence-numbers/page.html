    This should flash yellow for one second, then blue for one second, then
    repeat forever.

  <p>The following image is the same as the one above, except the sequence
  number in the first <code>`fdAT`</code> chunk has been changed from 1
  (valid) to 255 (invalid) and then the CRC32 of the chunk has been updated.

  It is unclear how such an invalid APNG should behave.
  https://crbug.com/369442793 suggests that Chromium/Blink will ignore the
  invalid sequence numbers.
